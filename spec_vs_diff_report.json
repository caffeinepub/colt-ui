  "summary": "Both REQ-34 and REQ-35 appear to be largely implemented in the diff. REQ-34: Secret tab is removed from Header.tsx (TABS array only contains Games, Proxy, Music, Colt AI, Store, More), App.tsx no longer imports or renders SecretTab. REQ-35: MusicTab.tsx correctly imports useAddCCoins, checks actor readiness, calls mutateAsync with BigInt(999999999), displays a success state, and shows error messages. However, SecretTab.tsx appears as a modified file rather than a removed file.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-34",
      "requirement": "SecretTab.tsx should be deleted/removed from the repository",
      "reason": "The diff shows SecretTab.tsx listed under MODIFIED FILES rather than REMOVED FILES. The 'REMOVED FILES' section explicitly lists 'none', meaning the file was not deleted. The requirement states to delete SecretTab.tsx.",
