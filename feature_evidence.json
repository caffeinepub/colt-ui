      "featureTitle": "Redesign the Proxy tab (ProxyTab.tsx) to feature a centered Google-style landing layout when no URL is loaded. Display a prominent logo area in the center of the page: a neon-styled icon or emblem with the text 'Colt UI' displayed next to it (inline, on the same line). Below the logo, render a wide, prominent search/URL input bar styled like Google's search bar but matching the existing dark neon/cyberpunk aesthetic (glassmorphism, neon glow border on focus). The bar should include a 'Go' or submit button inline or beneath it. Once a URL is submitted and loaded, the iframe fills the tab content area as before, with the status bar showing the current proxied URL. The centered landing layout is only shown when no URL is currently loaded.",
