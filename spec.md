# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add 5 new Colt-themed playable browser games to the existing Games tab.

**Planned changes:**
- Add **Colt Pong** — a Pong variant with a player paddle vs. CPU opponent, canvas-based with neon/cyberpunk aesthetic
- Add **Colt Tetris** — a Tetris variant with falling neon-colored tetrominoes
- Add **Colt Breakout** — a Breakout/Arkanoid variant with a paddle, ball, and destructible neon blocks
- Add **Colt Asteroids** — a top-down shooter where the player destroys neon asteroids
- Add **Colt Racer** — a top-down endless lane-dodging racer
- Each game has a live score counter and a restart mechanic (button or key press)
- Each game is accessible from a GlassCard in the existing GamesTab game grid, opening in the full-screen game view with a back button
- All new game components follow the same canvas-based pattern as FlappyColt.tsx and SnakeGame.tsx

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse 5 new game cards in the Games tab and play Colt Pong, Colt Tetris, Colt Breakout, Colt Asteroids, and Colt Racer directly in the browser, with scoring and restart support, alongside the existing Flappy Colt and Neon Snake games.
